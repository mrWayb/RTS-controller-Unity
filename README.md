# RTS-controller-Unity
Hello everyone, please don't throw stones... this is my first introduction to Unity and C#. I did camera control for RTS or RPG (similar to Titan Quest). I did it without neurons, guides, and used only C# knowledge and Unity documentation. Please give feedback and advice on what can be improved and where to optimize.This is also my first repository on Github.
The hierarchy of Pivot objects (any 3d object, then you plan to activate it when you hold down the mouse wheel to display an object with arrows (as in the Kenshi game)), the child is just an empty object and the camera is already glued to it. Next, we throw the script on the Pivot, and add objects to the hierarchy for correct initialization.
