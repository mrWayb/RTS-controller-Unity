# RTS-controller-Unity
Hello everyone, please don't throw stones... this is my first introduction to Unity and C#. I did camera control for RTS or RPG (similar to Titan Quest). I did it without neurons, guides, and used only C# knowledge and Unity documentation. Please give feedback and advice on what can be improved and where to optimize.
